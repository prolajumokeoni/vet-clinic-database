# vet-clinic-database
Solving some performance issues using EXPLAIN ANALYZE

# Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-databases/blob/main/db-structure/images/schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-databases/blob/main/db-structure/images/data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check queries.sql for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!
